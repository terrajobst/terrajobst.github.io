Welcome to my blog. I'm Immo Landwerth. I work as a Program Manager on the .NET team at Microsoft. Don't be too impressed: I'm neither a programmer nor a manager. I use Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel and sometimes Visual Studio to convince folks I know what developers want.

When I'm not annoying my co-workers with ideas on how we could make .NET a kick-ass platform I'm...well, there is not much time left because I even do this in my spare time. Program Manager at work, coder in my spare time. If you want to know what keeps me awake, check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/terrajobst).

## Why a blog?

> Just do it. You write for you first, people second. -- [James](https://twitter.com/debugthings/status/661993057529688065)

Like James I'm a selfish narcissist so I blog as an intellectual form of masturbation. Jokes aside, writing is *the* way to structure your thoughts. But it's easy to get trapped in your own preconceptions. The cure is feedback, which requires making your thoughts public.

I ponder whether I can keep up with blogging but I found some [excellent advice from Adam Ralph](http://adamralph.com/2015/09/28/blog-equals-weblog):

> This is my personal blog. I am not using it to sell services or convey a corporate message. It should be personal, even if it does have a general theme, such as software development. There's no reason I can't write posts in an informal or conversational style. There is no reason a post can't be short. A few mistakes here and there? Who cares? 

So be it. Let's see where this leads.
